    <h1 class="mb-4">$LEARN / $KNOW</h1>
    <p class="mb-6 ta-l">Education and skill certification has become unaffordable, and unreliable. $LEARN, the currency token, and $KNOW, the skill certification governance and redemption token provides a decentralized solution.
<br><br>
$LEARN is intended to operate as a generalized educational services currency. Providing buyers the ability to provide liquidity that can be redeemed by educators as compensation being awarded a portion of the educator’s fees. Acting as a decentralized educational loan process that incentivizes educators to provide tangible value to students. By incorporating a vesting process contingent on student meeting milestones or forfeiting funds, and a educator providing demonstrations of instruction to successively unlock more of the fee the decentralized loan model can be secured on both sides.
<br><br>
$KNOW is intended to be the community governance skill validation token and educator reputation token. Holders of $KNOW will be able to vote on criteria for a skill validation certification proposed by holders of $KNOW. But wrapping a reward of $KNOW provided to students and educators, $KNOW can also be used a non-inflationary reputation token. This way independent parties, such a product vendors seeking to define a certification standard can provide liquidity that can be used to fund educational grants and projects. And $KNOW wrapped in a NFT to prevent the regular awarding of $KNOW as a reputation can be combined with on-chain recording of vendor certifications that can be earned. A collection of NFTs, each identifying a specific certification earned, containing a balance of $KNOW to signify the reputation of the certification holder can also be used to vote on proposals to ensure that proposals are simply dictated by the highest bidder, but also influenced by holders who have proven their knowledge and ability to deliver educational value to the community.
